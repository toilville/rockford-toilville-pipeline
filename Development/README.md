## Script Validation

All scripts have been validated to ensure:
- Dependencies are documented
- File paths are correctly updated
- Functionality remains intact after reorganization
- Log outputs are redirected to proper logs/ directory

## Usage Notes

- Testing scripts should only be run in development environments
- Utility scripts may require environment variables (see .env.example)
- Archive scripts are kept for reference but may not work with current platform version
- All scripts now output logs to logs/current/ with automatic 7-day retention

## Maintenance

This documentation is automatically updated when scripts are reorganized.
