# Apple Contacts Backup

This folder is intended for Apple Contacts backup files (JSON format).

## What to Add Here
- Exported Apple Contacts data for backup and recovery
- Do NOT commit any files containing real contact information, emails, phone numbers, or other PII.
- Use anonymized or sample data for testing.

## PII Notice
Add `apple-contacts-backup-*.json` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of personal data.
