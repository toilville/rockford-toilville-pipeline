Still, Salesforce is what the CEO uses to track his revenue and everyone on the outside of the big three has integration for it. Benoit can't help taking potshots at Microsoft, but they share many of the same huge customers so what's the endgame here? Half a horse.

Oh, wait --- Everyone else! Amazon is super quiet on this front. The future of many smaller models can't be discounted."

* OpenAI  - a full horse in influence, if not ability.

* Microsoft (Consumer) - A half-horse that is struggling to get out the door because IT departments everywhere are super queasy about the notion of unlocking the desktop to the panopticon model (at least a model that is off-prem and not owned by the business).

* Microsoft - (Enterprise) a 75% horse that seemingly is ready to capitalize! They can use the popular models, the custom models, Purview permissions, and Fabric insights and can define your custom prompts and share them across your organization. 

The problem is that all this drags down the raw quality of the OpenAI models. It's increasingly harder to explain how generated AI quality is worse versus naive testing with a GPT Pro account. Its even harder to determine what steps are being done to improve it."

I'm not a huge fan of telling jokes or things like that unless you have dedicated content resources to keep this line of conversation fresh. But a well-timed joke can be super delightful. Just don't turn your bot in a Micheal Scott-type that drives a joke into the ground via repetition or trying to land a funny in an inappropriate situation.¬†"
2019-08-07 12:22:48,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6564841963860881408,"For me, I start with the error handling. The one thing people attribute to \"dumb machines\" is very precise input requirements. If a bot cannot do a thing, being able to say \"I'm sorry I do not know how to do that, but I CAN help you with topic x\" is a very human way of glossing over knowledge gaps. Have some sort of escalation path for situations like this can also improve the experience.
Next is empathy, which is very hard to do on a personal level but easily mocked using strong conception of the user story. For example, a bot can be designed to help a user troubleshoot their email, but a user might actually have a problem with their computer.¬†

Being able to support the issue, acknowledge what it clearly can't and cannot do, and offer some sort of actionable advice even on non-domain topics are all checkpoints on the way to being \"more human\"."
