It‚Äôs easy to blame hype, but the real issue is system integrity. Most teams aren‚Äôt struggling to ship because of tech gaps. They‚Äôre struggling because the standard shifted, and the process didn‚Äôt.  Your thinking around inferencing, expectation-setting, and clarity in AI feature delivery reflects the kind of leadership I write about in a weekly piece called Leader Philosopher. One original observation each week on how to lead when systems get complex, noisy, or out of sync with reality.  It‚Äôs free and shows up quietly in your feed.

I wanted to connect and share something compelling in the music investment space.  I am the Founder of AntiFragile Equity Partners, specializing in acquiring and growing music rights catalog revenues for mid-tier artists. With decades of experience in artist management and running record labels, I have built a team that significantly increases catalog revenues‚Äîoften achieving 10x to 20x growth across multiple platforms.  Our key insight is the continuous growth of music streaming. There are over 300,000 underexploited, reasonably-priced music catalogs available for acquisition at low multiples. We expand these revenues through our marketing tactics and the industry's growing streaming and licensing revenue opportunities.  We are currently raising our initial round of investment. We have established excellent momentum by raising over $1M, and by signing LOIs to purchase three artist catalogs, guaranteeing us over $1.5M in revenue for our first year.  Our proprietary tools identify attractive high-growth catalogs at reasonable prices, with almost no competition in our targeted market segment‚Äîproviding a unique advantage. Returns in this sector are uncorrelated to financial markets and immune to economic downturns.  I have attached our pitch deck [https://hubs.ly/Q02Kfg2d0] for more details.

Nice to meet you and hope you're well!  Reaching out to see if you might have a moment to connect soon. We've been working on an interesting magazine story about the evolution of Microsoft Copilot's products/business in the consumer and enterprise space. The company is participating, and we've already spent a lot of time in Redmond, which has been super helpful. I'm now just trying to balance out my understanding with some outside perspective, and wanted to see if you might be up for educating me given your past experience. Really, just hoping to chat about Microsoft's trajectory in AI, how things were resonating with customers during your time there (particularly with custom Copilots in Studio), and how you see the broader AI landscape shaping up.  If you're up for it, maybe we could find a few minutes to hop on the phone this week? I'd greatly appreciate it, and happy to talk on background/not-for-attribution (meaning anonymously) if that's easier with your new role at Toilville. Please just let me know -- and thanks in advance for your time and consideration!  Best, Austin",INBOX

Our clients enjoy an average reduction of 10-30% in taxes with a comprehensive tax mitigation  / distribution plan in place.   We specifically help those who are tired of feeling uncertain about paying too much in taxes. They may be you if believe in math and dislike taxes‚Ä¶   With our personalized approach and in-depth knowledge of tax laws and financial strategies, we can tailor a comprehensive plan to help you maximize your savings, minimize your tax burden, and achieve your financial goals with confidence.   If you already have a financial plan that‚Äôs perfect. Why? Because our tailored strategies consistently deliver results that exceed the norm. We often find people have a TAX LEAKAGE of over 2% even with an SP500 index fund.     Think of your financial journey like climbing Mount Everest. Most people focus on reaching the summit, but forget the treacherous descent. Similarly, many overlook the importance of tax planning, and end up paying too much in taxes on the way down.

Surrender: Letting go of subconscious blockers to success.  This approach led to growing from 1 employee to 120 with 0 turnover, all through internal referrals.

Over the years I have come to see patterns that many (if not most) tech orgs go through that slow them down even if they are growing in size.    I've narrowed it down to three practices that, if implemented correctly, arm product managers with the tools needed to successfully build quality software without jeopardizing speed or needing to spend more time ""managing"" instead doing the things they enjoy doing (like actually talking with customers and users).    In fact, I've seen great results with it over and over again... up to over 50% reduction in time to market! I‚Äôve just put together a short (and free!) training on this exact topic.    Would it be useful if I shared it with you?",INBOX

Quick question for you:    As a product manager, do you feel like it is impossible to get things done? The engineering team just takes too long to deliver anything, estimates are shot, and roadmaps are so unpredictable?    On top of that you have to deal with unmotivated engineers and getting their input feels like pulling teeth?    I ask because I‚Äôm putting together a short training for product and engineering leaders on how to reduce time to market, while being inspirational and without burning out the team.    Would love to hear your perspective if you're experiencing any of the above at Microsoft.

I work with Microsoft leaders..  Most people who are highly productive or have high stress positions like yours tend to struggle with ""their mindset --- specifically their inner critic"".    Sometimes mental dynamics get in their way of being promoted or even being joyful.  Life can even become difficult.  It's more common than you might think.  I have a 4-step process for taming your inner-critic and it's a secret tactic to help you become a better leader.  I can give you that system if you are interested.  No charge.  Let me know if you want it and I'll have my assistant get it over to you.   And if you want to go through the steps together, then we can get on a call -- again, no charge.

That‚Äôs 100% feasible. I‚Äôve signed you up on getwanted.com for$170 k. You should have received an email on peterswimm@gmail.com for confirmation. Don‚Äôt forget to check your spam. Once you accept it and after a short review, we will send you full details about the opportunities that match (or are above) this salary. So the way Wanted works is that as a talent, you just set your salary. Companies will reach out blind via Wanted only based on locations, skills & min. salary. That is when you (as a talent) will know about the company. You will get a page with all the details (committed salary of course but also perks, equity, project, team etc...) Then, only if you accept to reveal your profile, they will know more about you (like who you are). If you don‚Äôt like the offer, your profile keeps being anonymous.
