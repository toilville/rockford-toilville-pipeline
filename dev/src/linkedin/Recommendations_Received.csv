When I worked with Peter, I really liked that he could engage in lively discussions about how to build better bots. He helped everyone get up to speed on what a great UX experience could be. His work ethic is also superb. He is on his way to be a solid leader as he respects, listens, and appreciates different points of view. Keep working hard, Peter! :)","08/22/19, 04:20 AM",VISIBLE
