The biggest mistake my clients do, and in most resumes also is they all are lists of experience and education. It doesn’t work, and they complain about NO response, NO interview.     Your resume is you in person virtually.     Tell me the company is interested in you or not?    Of course, they are, but their interest is in knowing what you can do for them, what you contribute, how you performed the functions they are hiring you for?    Your NO Call and NO Interview will end with my resume. You will get an INTERVIEW your first step toward getting your next level better job.     The best way to interest hiring managers is to tell your successes the way they like to listen. I am good at it.     My resume will,     1.	Pass the ATS Application Tracking Software  2.

Interest hiring manager    See how I do it.   http://jobgettingresume.com/resume    In 2017 LinkedIn recognized my work and invited me to join their pilot program to review active job seekers profiles.

Wed Jun 20 14:39:19 UTC 2018,SERVICE_MARKETPLACE,"I'm confident I can produce a compelling résumé/LinkedIn that meets your objectives. First, we must position your résumé to get through the RoBot -- Applicant Tracking Software (ATS) -- which uses artificial intelligence to score your résumé against keywords from the job description. A low score means your résumé will not get reviewed by a recruiter.     You’ll receive from us a résumé and/or LinkedIn that 1) is written with precision and is grammatically correct, 2) uses valid keywords in context, 3) highlights your considerable accomplishments, and 4) is accurately formatted, all of which improves your ATS score.     Your résumé will also be written to grab the attention of the recruiter, who spends just 3–5 seconds glancing at your work history. And because we highlight your accomplishments, you’ll make an impression with the hiring manager, standing out against your competition.     After we’ve rewritten your résumé, we run it through software that generates an optimization score, which we share with you. We don’t ignore the Bots. We use them.     With recognized writing credentials and 30 years’ experience crafting résumés (and LinkedIn), we combine technology with exceptional writing. Please call me at 719-331-5275 or email ann.haehn@xpm2consulting.com. More about our services & testimonials can be found at http://xpm2resumeservices.com.     $295  Package includes: 1 hour consultation, optimization report, 1 résumé, cover letter, & LinkedIn recommendations. ",,,,true
